# hh8-minor-project-2
Project Description
The DDoS Detection Tool is a cybersecurity tool programmed under Python, and it observes and checks live network traffic to pinpoint high-frequency packet flooding. It checks for potential DDoS attacks through the detection and monitoring of a specified number of packets sent by IP addresses within a fixed 10-second time period. Automatically, after detecting a potential threat, an IP is marked and included in a list of blacklisted IPs.

What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
Basic Idea of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
How traffic rate analysis can be applied to the identification of anomalies
Implementation of a sliding time window for request counting
How does threshold-based detection work in IDS/IPS systems
The Significance of Suppression of Log Records to Hinder Alert Overflow
How security tools that are used on a daily basis monitor network traffic
Practical Skills with Python: data structures like deque and defaultdict
