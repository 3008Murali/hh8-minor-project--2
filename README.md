Project Description

This is a simple DDoS detection utility using Python with the Scapy library. It sniffs network traffic for a little while, finds suspicious IP addresses based on packet count, and blacklists them for demonstration purposes.

Tools Utilized
Python
Scapy
Npcap for packet sniffing on Windows
Overview of Git & GitHub

Running the Project
Install Python and Npcap
Install required library:
pip install scapy
Run the Program
